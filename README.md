# Binary-Search-Tree
INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a python document that initially takes a sequence of unsorted numbers as an array ‘l’. ‘l’ = [16,9,22,14,15,6] then sorts the array referring to the concept of binary search tree introduced in Chapter 5. Overall, this program implements the construction, insertion, and deletion of a binary search tree according to a sequence of unsorted numbers. There is also the function of inserting 8 into the binary search tree, and the deletion of 9 from the binary search tree. 

REQUIREMENTS
------------
No further requirements besides python version 3 or higher. 

RECOMMENDED MODULES
------------
